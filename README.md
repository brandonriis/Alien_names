# Alien_names
This program accepts the first and last names of multiple people
and then converts then into 'alien' names. Removing any names with no
vowels and giving the user the option to delete any names from the list.

The program contains an empty list as well as a list that has already
been populated in the 'alien' function. The populated list is missing
the name "Chloe Smyth' which once inputted completes the program giving
the correct output as per the specifications. The empty list can also be
used and the program will still work as intended but the final output
will be off because it relies on a specific list of names.
